# bool.js
_Insanely easy, way cool and f\*\*\*ing awesome. It's bool.js_

## What is bool.js?

Bool.js started as an architecture to achieve ease at creating new projects, and now, is more than this. Bool.js lets you create APIs in no time, using elements you already know or can easily learn. We invested our experience, love and countless days to give you the best development experience, so you don't have to do it twice.

Less kitten samples and more fun, it's bool.js.

## Prerequisites

* **Node.js v4.0.0 or later**: No, you can't escape from this, as our incredibly modern API uses the latest features of the ES6 standard, such as classes and that stuff.
* **Git 1.9.0 or later**: Recommended for having control in every aspect of your project as it rapidly grows.

## Let's begin

> _TL;DR_
>
> You can do it in two ways: the hard one or the easy one. The first implies cloning our boilerplate, taking your time to deeply know the workspace and begin the project by .

### The hard one

Start by cloning the boilerplate,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/booljs/booljs-boilerplate.git sample
```

Once you get it, open the folder where it is located and delete last

```bash
cd sample
rm -rf .git
git init
```

Then, initialize the project and install bool.js

```bash
npm init
npm install -S bool.js
```

Finally, modify line 2 in `index.js`, should look like this:
```js
var booljs = require('bool.js');
```

And fill out the base namespace of your application (yes, we use namespaces, I'll tell you about this later) in line 5. For example, if your API is being located in http://api.awesomeapp.com, your namespace would be something like:
```js
booljs('com.awesomeapp.api').run();
```

`index.js` will end up this way:

```js
'use strict';
var booljs = require('bool.js');

// Here is where magic happens
booljs('com.awesomeapp.api').run();
```

Now, you're ready to start.

### The easy one

Simple as this: install bool.js in your computer through npm.

```bash
sudo npm install -g bool.js
```

Then, use the CLI to start the application. Fill out the namespace (yes, we use namespaces, I'll tell you about this later) and the directory where your project is being created. In case you don't mention a path, CLI will use the one you're being located.

```bash
bool create <namespace> [dir]
```

Follow the instructions and you're done.

## First run

> Basic code comes with an example of: configuration files, found inâ€¦ configuration (D'Oh!) folder, controllers, DAO (or business logic, if you think in a better name than ours, let us know [here](mailto:hello@booljs.co)), models, and plugins.

We prepared a _kitten free_ sample using a dog store, where you can see how to create a resource. Just type `node index.js` and you're in.

## Dissecting workspace structure

> TL;DR
>
> Bool.js code are plain functions with at least one parameter: `app`, which is a reference to the namespace-based components, from where you can instantiate your code. Those return the objects you can use everywhere in your application. They can be controllers, DAO, models, routes and plugins.
>
> Models and routes are very strict in their structure, as they're the interfaces to connect the rest of the architecture and follow the specifications of the database and web server drivers. The others (unless specified) are designed up to your criteria, but please follow certain code styles.
>
> Finally, depending on how you name your files, they will be referenced as CamelCase classes in the namespace structure.

### Modules: what are them?

A module is basically a function containing executable code, which passes parameters referencing the application's other components through namespaces, as well as other parameters: database drivers, libraries, etc. You can recognize them as code files into the following folders: `controllers`, `dao`, `plugins`, `models` and `routes`.

They consist in three parts: the header definitions, the code body and the returning object. Now, let's examine very carefully each one of these.

#### Header definitions

This is the part of code defining what is going to be exported as a component. Consists on a `use strict` header, because we like to be strict, but safe; and a `module.exports` sentence returning a function. The function takes at least one parameter: can be called whatever you want, but we recommend to call it `app`, so you will know it is about the application's status.

```js
'use strict';

module.exports = function (app) {

};
```

#### Code body

Essentially is the part where you can work on your code. Here you are free to do whatever you want, with some recommendations.

1. Don't use `require`. The reason to make bool.js namespace-based is precisely to avoid making complicated calls to files. If you have a recurring piece of code you want to use, then create a module of it in the `plugins` folder, and then you can call it instantiating the component `app.plugins.WhateverYouCanCallItPlugin`.
2. Never declare variables or running code outside code body, before or after the function definition. This is an anti-pattern as can turn your code non-stateless, and eventually create you troubles to yourself.
3. Declare variables to point constructors: then, in the returning functions, instantiate them, so you'll mantain your code stateless.



### The router stuff

**Router components** are _modules_ that contain an array of routes that must be deployed by the web server driver. A route
